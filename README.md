🛠️ ARM Assembler for Data Processing & Branch Instructions
A lightweight C++ assembler that encodes ARMv7 Data Processing and Branch instructions into 32-bit binary and hexadecimal machine code. Designed for accuracy and clarity, this project supports:

✅ Full encoding of ARM Data Processing instructions (ADD, SUB, MOV, etc.)

✅ Shift operations with immediate or register source (LSL #3, ROR v2)

✅ Condition code parsing (EQ, GT, NE, AL, etc.)

✅ Register alias support (a1, v7, sp, etc.)

✅ Branch instructions (B, BL, BEQ, etc.) with PC-relative offset encoding

✅ Modular architecture with separate instruction handlers

Whether you're learning ARM internals, building a compiler backend, or just geeking out over binary encodings, this assembler provides a focused, hands-on foundation. Inspired by low-level engineering and a love for precision.
